# PrioPlus

This repository is the open-source implementation of the PrioPlus paper for EuroSys'25 with scripts for reproducing figures presented in the paper. Additionally, supplementary materials for the paper can be found here.

This repository is based on the ns-3 codebase internally maintained by NASA-NJU, which is built on ns-3.40 and developed collaboratively by several NASA-NJU members.

## Code

We have modularized our modifications to ensure compatibility with the original ns3. Our main modules are the `src/dcb` (Data center bridging) module and the `src/json-util` module. 

- The `src/dcb` module implements the RDMAv2 protocol stack.
- The `src/json-util` module includes utility code for easily experimental configuration and result output via JSON.

Furthermore, we have made minor modifications to the original ns3 code, primarily to optimize routing functionality and to change the forwarding table from linear search to hash lookup (based on our experience, this can reduce experiment time by over 40% in topologies with 320 switches).

Demos for part of workloads and congestion control algorithms supported by our code base can be found in `config/demos` with `config/demos/run-all.sh` being the one-click script to run them all.

## Reproduce PrioPlus

### Configure the project

Configure ns3 using the following command:

```bash
./ns3 configure -d release --enable-examples --enable-tests --disable-gtk --cmake-prefix-path '/path/to/your/boost/' --enable-mtp
```

Note that the `src/json-util` module relies on the `boost::json` library and requires installing `boost` version 1.75 or higher. If there is an existing version of the boost library in the system that is currently in use and it's inconvenient to configure the PATH, you can directly specify the path to the boost library using `--cmake-prefix-path`.

When debuging your code, you can configure with `-d debug`. The `-d optimized` configuration is not recommended as there are some known platform-specfic bugs. According to our test, `-d optimized` is not much faster than `-d release` on our Intel server.

### Run experiments

The configs are put in `config/prioplus-eurosys25/experiments` which can be run by running `config/prioplus-eurosys25/experiments/run_all.sh` in one click. 

Note that finishing all the experiments need 4 hours on our server with Intel 48-core CPU @ 2.2GHz and 256 GB memory. It may take much more time on a desktop PC.

### Plot figures

All the figure codes used in our experiments are placed in `config/prioplus-eurosys25/figure-code`. You can reproduce the figure with them. We have atteched the reproduced figures in the ipython notebook for your convenience.

## Future Evolution of this Repository

We are still developing new features for our codebase internally, focusing on:

1. Supporting a general flow control framework
2. Supporting advanced AI training and inference workloads (considering integration with SimAI)
3. Addressing known minor issues in the existing framework to make it more robust

In the feature, the main open-source content will be released with our following papers publishing. If you would like to contribute to the codebase, please submit a PR directly, or contact us for more in-depth discussion and collaboration.
